During apoptosis, further proteolytic processing leads to a mature form, which is confined to the mitochondrial IMS in a soluble form (AIFsol). AIFsol is released to the cytoplasm in response to specific death signals, and translocated to the nucleus, where it induces nuclear apoptosis (PubMed:15775970). Release into the cytoplasm is mediated upon binding to poly-ADP-ribose chains (By similarity). Translocation into the nucleus is promoted by interaction with (auto-poly-ADP-ribosylated) processed form of PARP1 (PubMed:33168626). Colocalizes with EIF3G in the nucleus and perinuclear region (PubMed:17094969). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0X1, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15775970, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17094969, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33168626}.; SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Isoform 3]: Mitochondrion intermembrane space {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20111043}.

Colocalizes with URI1 at mitochondrion (PubMed:17936702). Rapidly exchanges between the nucleolar, nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic compartments (PubMed:11739654). Highly mobile in cells and can be relocalized through interaction with targeting subunits (PubMed:17965019). In the presence of PPP1R8 relocalizes from the nucleolus to nuclear speckles (PubMed:11739654). Shows a dynamic targeting to specific sites throughout the cell cycle (PubMed:12529430). Highly concentrated in nucleoli of interphase cells and localizes at kinetochores early in mitosis (PubMed:12529430). Relocalization to chromosome-containing regions occurs at the transition from early to late anaphase (PubMed:12529430). Also accumulates at the cleavage furrow and midbody by telophase (PubMed:12529430). Colocalizes with DYNLT4 in the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) (PubMed:23789093). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P63087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11739654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12529430, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17936702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17965019, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23789093}.","IPR051254;IPR019523;",13,NA,"Complete"," ",NA,"sepmito_01386160_PR15A_PP1G",NA,NA,NA,"FALSE",1,16.1782951152886,1.27806347135494,1.63344623681183,0.008601,"0.00264302757987881","0.0514103839693774","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE",NA,NA
